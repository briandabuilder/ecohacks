# Welcome to EcoHacks!

Who are we? EcoHacks is an ONLINE hackathon that aims to find sustainable solutions to some of the worldâ€™s greatest environmental challenges. Ten million hectares of forest are lost every year. Global temperatures are expected to rise 1.5 degrees in the next two decades and anywhere from 3 to 12 degrees by 2100. One-third of coral reefs have died off and over 12,000 species are threatened with extinction. As the growing epidemic of environmental issues, especially those exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, worsens, we are in need of the next generation of developers to help us find innovative ideas to tackle these challenges.

Whether you have no experience or 10+ years of experience coding, we hope that you all can join us in our event. Our hackathon runs from 9/3 - 9/5, where participants will be able to collaborate and meet new people, create original projects, share innovative ideas, attend various computer science related workshops, and guest speaker events! Teams of up to 4 people are allowed and no code can be written prior to the event. Check out are website below!
